This is the Readme for the fifth step in the Turbidostat Lit/Dark DHFR-LOV2 chimera mutagenesis experiments Step_5_analysis_and_figures). 


ipynb file 1rx2.pdb is a protein databank file of DHFR (rcsb.org/structure/1rx2, DOI: 10.1021/bi962337c) and is used in both scripts for structural analysis and figure generation. 


DHFR_ConsVals.txt contain conservations values from three alignments. It contains four columns: 
	First is the position 1-159 of DHFR
	Second is Di_418_curated conservation scores (this is the alignment used in Reynolds 2011, DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.049)
	Third is Di_EggNOG conservation scores
	Fourth is Di_PSIBlast_Large conservation scores


contactgraph_bb.csv is used by SectorSurfaceDefinitions.ipynb. The contact information for DHFR was originally generated by Rama Ranganathan using 1RX2.pdb. SectorSurfaceDefinitions.ipynb elaborates on it's content and generation. 


The python (3.4) script SectorSurfaceDefinitions.ipynb is written for jupyter notebooks, contains markdown, and can be run in this directory on a personal computer. It is a compilation of data from Reynolds 2011 (PMID: 22196731) in one place to facilitate analysis. Previously this information was stored in supplemental of paper, matlab scripts, and an excel sheet. While this notebook does not output any files or produce data, the sector definitions at various p-value cutoffs, surface sites, and sector contacting surface sites are defined. This script is not needed, but is included to explain the origin of those definitions which are used in ./allostery_analysis.ipynb


The python (3.4) script allostery_analysis.ipynb is written for jupyter notebooks, contains markdown, and can be run in this directory on a personal computer. The notebook takes the growth rate and allostery data produced in step 4, Growth_Rate_and_allostery, and producing all the data and figures used in the associated publication. The raw figures are saved as PDF files in ./FigPanels and the positions found to significantly alter allostery are saved as a pickle database (.pkl files for saving python variables containing the data) in ./output
